Realtime streaming media analytics. This plugin will detect most YouTube, Vimeo, and HTML5 videos.

== Description ==

MediaGauge's WordPress plugin works by including a javascript library that checks each page's HTML for video and audio
players and then listens for user events like "play", "pause", "finish", and "fullscreen". These events are sent to
MediaGauge's API where they are recorded for later analysis. You can then login to MediaGauge.com and see realtime and
historical charts that allow you to better understand how your visitors are engaging with your media.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/mediagauge-analytics` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Check that your domain is set correctly in the MediaGauge Analytics settings.
4. Create an account with MediaGauge and login to view your analytics dashboard.
